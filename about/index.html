I am a modem software engineer. Currently, I work in <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><font color="blue">Qualcomm</font></a>. I graduated from <a href="http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><font color="blue">Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(NUAA)</font></a> in June,2016 and got my bachelor’s degree in Testing and Control Technologies Instrument major. Then I went to <a href="https://english.ucas.ac.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><font color="blue">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS)</font></a> in Sept,2016 to study further as a postgraduate student, majoring in Signal and Information Processing. After receiving my master’s degree in July,2019, I headed toward Shenzhen,China and had been working in Qualcomm’s Shenzhen branch office as a modem software engineer until now. For more details about me, please either click my CV below or just continue browsing this webpage. For my research interests, please click my research statement below.</p>

<h2 id="Work-History"><a href="#Work-History" class="headerlink" title="Work History"></a>Work History</h2><p>I landed my first job in July,2019. Since then, I have been working in Qualcomm as a modem software engineer, as stated above. Focusing on MAC,RLC and PDCP layers of the LTE protocol stack, I took part into the chipset off target implementation of Qualcomm’s newest baseband processors, such as X50, X55. Debugging the code from L2 perspective(i.e. MAC,RLC and PDCP layers) is a part of my daily routine. Moreover, I provide technical support and solutions for issues reported from modem testing team and customers. In the coming months, I will also participate in Qualcomm’s 5G NR/LTE modem software design and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="Undergraduate-Academic-Performance"><a href="#Undergraduate-Academic-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Undergraduate Academic Performance"></a>Undergraduate Academic Performance</h3><p>Being a constant top ten student and scholarship laureate in my department, I had won various awards and honors throughout the four years of my undergraduate career. In my sophomore year, I ranked the first out of 85 students altogether in my department with a GPA of 4.0(4.0/5.0). My excellent GPA plus some other contest awards and honors I won added up to my outstanding academic performance. It brought me a National Scholarship in my sophomore year, which is an award only several students out of almost 700 students can win each year in my college. At the end of my junior year, I got an exemption qualification to be a postgraduate student. Then I chose University of Chinese Academy of Sciences as the next station of my life.</p>
<h3 id="Postgraduate-Academic-Performance"><a href="#Postgraduate-Academic-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Postgraduate Academic Performance"></a>Postgraduate Academic Performance</h3><p>From July,2016 to June,2019, I had spent 3 years in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. The first year was all about taking classes. Honestly, my performance was not so good in this year. My overall GPA was only 3.09(3.09/4.0). The landslide of my grade was partly due to some sort of skin disease that haunted me at that time. I was suffering from it and searching for cure every month. Meanwhile, some of the advanced courses I took required some prerequisite knowledge that I lacked. I was struggling in the difficult situation and gradually lost my steam. Then I just lagged behind. I started my redemption tour from the second year of my postgraduate duration. I went to <a href="http://english.aircas.ac.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><font color="blue">Aerospace Information Research Institute,AIRCAS</font></a>, an affiliate of Chinese Academy of Sciences, to undertake research. From Jul.,2017 to Dec.,2018, I spent one and a half years in this institute. During this period, I had taken part into 2 engineering projects and successfully finished them. Later, I went out for an internship and started a new life.</p>
<h2 id="Internship"><a href="#Internship" class="headerlink" title="Internship"></a>Internship</h2><p>From Dec.,2018 to Jun.,2019, I worked in Qualcomm as an intern. During that time, I learned some knowledge of wireless communication, especially LTE. I started off with reading MAC,RLC and PDCP layer specifications(TS36.321,TS36.322,TS36.323) in detail. Then I read some code regarding these layers and learned how to implement them in engineering. After I had a general sense of MAC,RLC and PDCP protocols, I began to learn how to analyze the log and fix issues. I continued to learn LTE knowledge while helping the modem team solve some minor problems. Finally, after I got my master’s degree at the end of June,2019, I joined Qualcomm formally.</p>

<h2 id="Research-Experience"><a href="#Research-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Research Experience"></a>Research Experience</h2><h3 id="Undergraduate-Research-Experience"><a href="#Undergraduate-Research-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Undergraduate Research Experience"></a>Undergraduate Research Experience</h3><p>I had done a host of course projects throughout my undergraduate career, but I have already forgotten the details for most of them. Here I just list some projects that I still remember.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Frequency-to-Voltage Converter(built on a breadboard using miscellaneous components)</li>
<li>A Digital Alarm Clock(built on a breadboard using miscellaneous components)</li>
<li>A Simple Voltemeter(Write a program using Assembly language for a hardware platform)</li>
<li>A Weighing Instrument(Write a testing and control program using LabVIEW for a hardware platform)</li>
<li>A Simulated Air-conditioner(Write a testing and control program using LabVIEW for a hardware platform)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the course projects for courses <strong>Analog Electronic Technology</strong>, <strong>Digital Circuits and System Design</strong>, <strong>Basic Computer Hardware Technology II</strong>, <strong>Computer Testing Systems II</strong>, <strong>Measurement and Control Communication Technology</strong> respectively. These projects trained my engieer mindset and enlightened me on electronics and computer science.</p>
<p>My graduation design is about a ground control program used for controlling the orientation of a high-altitude balloon-borne gondola and monitoring its ambient condition. The program was written in LabVIEW. Through reading the packets transmitted back to the ground by the telemeter, it can monitor some parameters of the balloon-borne gondola, such as attitude, position, altitude, velocity, acceleration etc. By displaying these parameters in numeric or waveform format, the condition of the gondola is demonstrated in a more straightforward manner, which helps the experimenting crew a lot. The program can also log the flight data of the high-altitude balloon so that the researchers can extract it from the flash and replay the flight trajectory of the balloon after the experimental equipment is recycled.</p>
<h3 id="Postgraduate-Research-Experience"><a href="#Postgraduate-Research-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Postgraduate Research Experience"></a>Postgraduate Research Experience</h3><p>I took part into 2 engineering projects during my postgraduate time. In the first project, I cooperated with 2 other engineers to make an embedded computer used for controlling the orientation of a high-altitude balloon-borne gondola and logging its flight data into the memory. I joined into the software design and completed part of the program. Specifically, I transplanted an embedded RTOS, UCOS III onto a processor, STM32H743XI. Then I wrote all the drivers for each part of the embedded computer, including NAND Flash, SPI, USART, FMC, ADC, DMA, CAN etc. I also wrote some tasks of the program. The embedded computer was put into use in a flight experiment and operated normally for the whole process.</p>
<p>In the second project, I collaborated with another engineer to make a flight control computer used for controlling a solar-powered UAV. I completed the whole process of hardware design and also wrote part of the software. The hardware is composed of a DSP SOC TMS320C6748, a FPGA chip XC4VLX40, DDR, NAND Flash, SPI Flash, CAN controller, ADC, USART, EPWM module and watch dog. After I finished the PCB layout and made a prototype circuit board, I wrote the drivers for each peripheral, including NAND Flash, SPI Flash, CAN controller, ADC, USART, EPWM, EMIFA, watch dog, etc. To add more UART and SPI interfaces, I also wrote a UART IP core by referring to the design of 16550, a classical UART chip, and a SPI IP core. </p>
<h2 id="Publications"><a href="#Publications" class="headerlink" title="Publications"></a>Publications</h2><p>I had published 2 articles on some Chinese journals during my postgraduate period. </p>
